  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: May 6, 2025</p>

  <p>FundIQSG ("we", "our", or "us") is a local, offline-only accounting app designed to help you manage your personal finances securely on your own device. Your privacy is very important to us.</p>

  <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
  <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal or financial data. All information you enter into FundIQSG remains on your device and is never shared with us or any third parties.</p>

  <p>FundIQSG operates fully offline. The app does not require an internet connection to function, and it does not communicate with any servers or external services.</p>

  <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
  <p>Because your data is stored locally on your device, you are solely responsible for backing it up and keeping your device secure. We recommend enabling device-level security features such as screen lock or encryption.</p>

  <h2>4. No Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We do not use any third-party analytics tools, advertising networks, or external libraries that would collect data from your device.</p>

  <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>FundIQSG is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
